_____

1. Two to three world catchy title: Full Stack (Creative? Creativity? Creator?)

2. Full-Stack Software Developer and Digital Artist with a background in game development and seven years of design experience. A proven candidate for leadership roles and reliable team member with a heavy focus on empathetic practices to build camaraderie among coworkers in order to reach creative and inclusive solutions for any given problem.

3. I'm a full-stack software developer and digital artist with a background in game design & development. I was initially focused on creating 3D assets for games but eventually started to delve into the programming side of things and was fascinated by it. I started down this path because I believe my aptitude for art, design, creative thinking and my interest in tech can ultimately coalesce into creating appealing and engaging web content for everyone. My supervisors and coworkers have consistently praised my diligence and capacity for empathy and teamwork and that makes me a strong addition to any team. Ideally, I would like to work for an organization that provide access to resources for people who really need it and helps to create systemic changes across historically unjust institutions.

4. The thing that excites me most about tech is how powerful it can be, particularly in regards to things like Shaders and RayTracing in gaming, and how rewarding it feels to learn how to control and harness its capabilities.
